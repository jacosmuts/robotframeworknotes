# Notes on Udemy RobotFramework course

# [course 1 Robot Framework Test Automation - Level 1 (Selenium)](https://www.udemy.com/course/robot-framework-level-1/)

Some of the content is slightly dated since the latest releases of PyCharm and robotframework, but all in all a good course to introduce principles.

## Section 1

Just a general overview.

## Section 2

Future note: This section is dated and doesn't cover python venv's in pycharm - I will add my own [setup notes](setup_notes.md) in due time.

### Video 7
